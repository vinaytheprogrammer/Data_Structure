# Data Structure Code Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in different programming languages. The code provided here is intended for educational purposes and can serve as a reference for understanding how different data structures are implemented.

## Available Data Structures

1. **Array**: Implementation of a dynamic array that automatically resizes when needed.
2. **Linked List**: Implementation of a singly linked list and a doubly linked list.
3. **Stack**: Implementation of a stack using arrays and linked lists.
4. **Queue**: Implementation of a queue using arrays and linked lists.
5. **Binary Tree**: Implementation of a binary tree with functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
6. **Binary Search Tree**: Implementation of a binary search tree with functions for insertion, deletion, and search.
7. **Heap**: Implementation of a binary heap with functions for insertion, deletion, and heapification.
8. **Hash Table**: Implementation of a hash table with separate chaining for collision resolution.
9. **Graph**: Implementation of a graph using adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations.
10. **Trie**: Implementation of a trie data structure for efficient string searching.

## Languages Used

- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
